# twenty_forty_eight

This is a ported version of my implementation of [2048 in Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/TwentyFortyEight)
It only implements a small subset of its functionality at the moment, I decided to create a port because
I wanted to have some fun with a compiled language for a change and Crystal so far has been awesome to write in!

A next step will be to add a TUI so that one can play the game within a terminal, using keys to move, quit and restart
